## 2. Purpose Rule

Every page must serve at least one purpose:

- document a decision
- share a lesson
- publish a build log
- reflect on failure
- describe an experiment

If a page does not serve a purpose, it must not exist.

## 3. Content Rule

All projects are case studies, not showcases.

Each build log MUST include:

1. Context
2. Problem
3. Why existing solutions failed

No exceptions.

Structure always comes before implementation.

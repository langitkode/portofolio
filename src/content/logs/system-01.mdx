# Context

Every engineer needs a public record. Most choose a portfolio—a gallery of screenshots and tech stacks. I needed a lab.

# Problem

Static portfolios are marketing sites. They hide the mess. They hide the trade-offs. They hide the _engineering_. I wanted a system that prioritizes the narrative of the build over the visual of the result.

# Why existing solutions failed

- **GitHub**: Too much noise. READMEs are for users, not for reflecting on architecture.
- **Blogs**: Too disconnected. I wanted the documentation to live alongside the system's identity.
- **Portfolios**: Too polished. No room for "this broke and I don't know why yet."

# System design

The system is built on **TanStack Start**. It uses a "Static-First, Interaction-Second" approach.

- **Content**: MDX-driven writing. Portable, version-controlled.
- **Interactions**: Convex-driven reactions and views. Minimal, serverless.
- **Styling**: Grayscale, 720px max-width. Focused on reading.

# Architecture

```

# Trade-offs

I chose TanStack Start over Next.js.
_Trade-off_: Smaller ecosystem, but significantly better type safety for search params and transitions.

# What broke

Initial directory structure was nested too deep due to CLI defaults. Had to script a flattening process to maintain root-level clarity.

# What was learned

Readability is a technical constraint. By restricting the layout to 720px, I'm forcing the content to be the primary engine of the site.

# Result

A minimalist, high-performance identity site that feels like a technical manual.

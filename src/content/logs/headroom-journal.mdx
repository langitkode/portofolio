## Context

Headroom Journal is a content platform dedicated to documenting music, art, and pop culture narratives.  
The site was intended to allow non-technical authors and editors to publish content independently without requiring code deployments.

It integrates a headless CMS to separate content management from site rendering, giving authors a UI experience while maintaining a performant frontend.

## Problem

Before implementing a CMS, the editorial workflow was:

- content stored in static files
- site updates required developer involvement
- publishing content was slow or error-prone
- status updates were difficult to preview

The core problem was **editor dependency on developer releases**, not content quality.

## Why Existing Solutions Failed

- Static markdown workflows lack live editor interfaces
- Simple blogs do not support structured content well
- Traditional CMS require heavy backend infrastructure

None of these approaches provided a **quick, collaborative editorial workflow** integrated with a modern frontend.

Sanity provides a real-time, schema-based CMS that solves most of these editorial constraints.

## System Design

The platform separates:

- **CMS content**: authored in Sanity Studio
- **Rendering**: handled by Next.js via GROQ queries
- **Frontend**: optimized for fast delivery and SEO

The design allows editors to craft and update content without code deployments, while Next.js builds pages using static or incremental rendering.

## Architecture

### CMS (Sanity)

- Headless content models for posts, tags, authors
- GROQ queries to fetch structured content
- Real-time editing capabilities

### Frontend (Next.js)

- Dynamic routes for articles
- Uses server-side or static rendering for performance
- Tailwind CSS for design
- Components powered by Sanity data

### Deployment

- Frontend deployed on Vercel
- Sanity hosted in the cloud

## Trade-offs

- Dependence on Sanity as a third-party CMS (vendor lock-in)
- GROQ query language learning curve
- Content updates sometimes require ISR refresh
- TypeScript types may require manual maintenance with schema changes

These trade-offs were chosen for editorial workflow benefits and rapid iteration.

## What Broke

- Preview caching delays at times
- Some schema changes broke rendering until types updated
- Image rendering and optimization took extra config

These issues led to documentation on schema updates and ISR configurations for editors.

## What Was Learned

- Headless CMS dramatically improved editorial autonomy
- GROQ and Next.js integration can be optimized further
- Structured content modeling is essential for future features
- Editors need clear content guidelines

## Result

- A live, editor-driven journal site
- Content publishable without developer deployments
- Fast, SEO-friendly rendering
- Sustainable editorial workflow

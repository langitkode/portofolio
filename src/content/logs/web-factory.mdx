## Context

Building websites for UMKM is usually slow because each site is treated as a custom project.  
In practice, most of the work is repetitive: project setup, layout wiring, deployment, and hosting configuration.

This system was created to turn website creation into a repeatable manufacturing process instead of manual craftsmanship.

## Problem

UMKM need websites quickly for validation and marketing, but developers cannot scale manual builds.

The real bottleneck is not design or coding, but deployment and operational overhead.

One developer cannot reliably ship dozens of sites without automation.

## Why Existing Solutions Failed

- Page builders generate low-quality output
- CMS still require manual setup per site
- Agencies scale people, not systems
- Deployment is always manual
- Hosting is a barrier for non-technical users

No existing tool treated websites as generated artifacts.

## System Design

UMKM Web-Factory treats each website as a compiled tenant from structured data.

Core principles:

- tenant config is JSON
- template is deterministic
- preview and production are separated
- deployment is automated end-to-end
- marketer can operate without developer help

A single command produces a live website.

## Architecture

### Admin Layer

- Admin dashboard to manage tenant data
- Template selection
- Tenant JSON configuration

### Generator Engine

- Node.js-based CLI
- Generates clean Next.js project
- Injects selected template only
- Removes unused code paths
- Static export optimized

### Preview Pipeline

Command:

```bash
npm run generate <tenant-id> preview
```

This automatically:

- creates Next.js project
- initializes git repo
- creates public GitHub repository
- pushes code
- deploys to Cloudflare Pages
- outputs live preview URL

Preview sites are used for door-to-door marketing.

### Production Pipeline

Command:

```bash
npm run promote <tenant-id>
```

This:

- creates private GitHub repository
- deploys production site
- prepares for custom domain
- optionally deletes preview

### Infrastructure

- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages
- Source Control: GitHub (repo per tenant)
- Execution: Local machine (no VPS)
- Tracking: generated-sites.json
- Secrets: .env.local (never committed)

### Trade-offs

- Local execution instead of VPS (zero cost vs reliability)
- Static sites only (scale vs flexibility)
- Limited template choices (speed vs customization)
- CLI-driven workflow (power vs usability)
- GitHub repo per tenant (isolation vs overhead)

## What Was Learned

- Websites are data, not projects
- Deployment is the real bottleneck
- Determinism simplifies scaling
- Non-dev operators need guardrails
- Infra automation beats UI builders

## Result

- Dozens of sites generated in days
- Door-to-door marketing enabled
- Zero hosting cost
- One developer replaced agency workflow
- System now acts as internal SaaS platform

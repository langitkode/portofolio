## Core Components

- **Vite + React Router**  
  The core engine providing high-performance static builds and client-side navigation without SSR complexity.

- **Convex Interaction Store**  
  A serverless backend lake for real-time reactions and page views, decoupled from the main content delivery.

- **MDX Data Layer**  
  The source of truth for technical narratives, combining markdown with interactive components.

- **Technical UI Components**  
  Minimalist, constrained typography and layout system (720px max-width) designed for reading efficiency.

- **Generation Scripts**  
  Automation layer for creating standardized log and architecture templates to reduce operational friction.

## Invariants

- Content must be readable without JavaScript (Hydration optional for text)
- The UI must never rely on explicit borders or separators (Whitespace-driven)
- State transitions must not block content rendering
- Every build log must link to its corresponding architecture blueprint if available
- Interactions (Convex) must fail gracefully to local storage

## Key Decisions

- Pivot from TanStack Start to Vite + React Router to minimize deployment complexity
- Use grayscale-only aesthetics to emphasize content over visual noise
- Standardize on Mermaid.js for all architectural diagrams
- Decouple backend interactions from the static content layer
- Enforce 720px max-width for optimal reading speed

## Failure Modes

- Backend (Convex) disconnect resulting in stale or missing reaction counts
- MDX hydration errors due to component version drifts
- Deployment failures when build artifacts exceed platform limits
- Performance degradation when loading complex Mermaid diagrams
- Route mismatches when slug names drift between log and architecture folders
